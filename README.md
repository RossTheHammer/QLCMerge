# QLCMerge
**Difference and Merge QLC+ Project Files**

This utility has been created to assist when two or more persons are working in conjunction but separately on a QLC+ project. The end goal is a tool that can be used to merge two files that began as the same file but have diverged due to concurrent work on different computers.

### State of the Projects

Initial publication of this tool provides a basic command line interface to compare two files, receiving a report of all differences and where they fully diverge from each other (their "fork" point). 

**TODO:**

* Auto-merge all new Function entries
* Graphical side-by-side differencing and manual merging view

## Installation
There is no installation, just copy the output files to a directory.

## Usage
QLCMerge.exe _{left-file-path}_ _{right-file-path}_

## History
* v0.1.0 (2023-04-01) - Initial publish to GitHub, provides simple console-based differencing only (not an April Fools joke! :D )
